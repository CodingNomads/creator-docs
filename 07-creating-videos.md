# IN SHORT

* short videos, if possible no longer than 5-8 minutes
* stable setup, avoid background noise
* to make editing easier:
    - use zoom, use pause
    - don't talk while coding lengthily if it gets you off track, then better explain when finished
    - name file with the title of the video
    - add notes in doc
        * mistake to cut and their timestamps
        * where screen overlay is needed and what should go on there

# welcome video
- with google sheets powerpoint
- mostly talk-over

# as long as necessary
- 5 to 8 minutes, better shorter

# tips
- when there's only coding, don't talk anything
    - helpful for editing when there is no sound
- easy to speed it up in editing
- at the end quickly explain what you did
- avoid background noise
- avoid 'ahems' etc. - it feels much more professional
- mostly use screenshares, you can also sometimes show your face if you want to
- be explicit about when there are mistakes (what time etc.) - quicker to cut them out when editing
    - undo to get back to working version
    - when realizing that explanation doesn't go too well

- title of videos (saved filename)
- add a README for notes about editing
- note when there should be a screen overlay (e.g. mis-naming when talking)

- when recording yourself, make sure your recording setup and table is stable, so that the camera doesn't move
- at a minimum, use headphones and a headphone mic
- if you have a better microphone, please use that instead

- upload the finished recordings to a google photos folder for sharing
