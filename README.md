# CodingNomads Course Creator Docs

This resource provides helpful guidelines for creating courses on CodingNomads' Learning Platform. It aims to:

* **Avoid common pitfalls:** We've learned our lessons while creating courses. Let's avoid making the same mistakes over again.
* **Assure quality content:** Our courses aim to provide great education to our students. These guidelines will help you to understand what that means for us.
* **Standardize content layout:** All courses are different, but we want to standardize their layout as much as possible, to make it easy for students to navigate across multiple courses.
* **Unify styling:** To make the general appearance uniform and allow us to apply site-wide style-changes, we use Bootstrap.
* **Explain workflows:** Some workflows are specific to our platform. Read about them here and avoid hair loss when firguring it out yourself.
* **Cast our teaching methods in writing:** We have ideas on what makes a great learning experience, and how to support it through the course material and its presentation.

**Note:** These docs are a living document and in their early stages. We are thankful for your contribution in making them better.
