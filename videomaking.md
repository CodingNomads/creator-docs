# IN SHORT

* short vids, if possible
* stable camera, avoid background noise
* ease editing:
    - use zoom, use pause
    - don't talk while coding lengthily, explain when finished
    - name file with title
    - add notes in doc
        * mistake timestamps
        * where screen overlay is needed

# welcome video
- with google sheets powerpoint
- mostly talk-over

# as long as necessary
- 5 to 10 min, better shorter

# tips
- when there's only coding, don't talk anything
    - helpful for editing when there is no sound
- easy to speed it up in editing
- at the end quickly explain what I did
- no background sound
- avoid ahems etc. - feels much more professional
- mostly screenshares
- explicit about when there are mistakes (what time etc.) - cut out when editing
    - undo to get back to working version
    - when realizing that explanation doesn't go too well

- title of videos (saved filename)
- add a README for notes about editing
- note when there should be a screen overlay (e.g. mis-naming when talking)

- make sure the table is stable (camera doesn't move)
- use headphones and headphone mic

- google photos folder for sharing
