# Consistently Styled Course Content

**Note:** **Use Markdown** to create your course content. It will make most of the below information irrelevant to you. If you feel the need to style more individually, [**use Bootstrap classes**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/). Bootstrap is included in the theme we're using. Only if neither fulfills your creative urges, read on for more fine-grained styling.

## Objective

We want **unified and adaptable styling** across all courses on the whole site.

- **Simple**: Simple elements are favored over complex ones, because they are easier to set up and maintain
- **Reusable**: Allow Bootstrap to style your page, it's already included.
- **Maintainable**: Through consistent and simple structure, we can adapt styles centrally and avoid unnecessary effort and potential misalignment

Therefore, we ask you to use **simple HTML** (e.g. through using the Markdown editor or the WYSIWYG editor) and customize the resulting HTML only minimally, with the following custom components:

## Custom Components

Additional custom components you can use when creating and editing courses.

### Course Overview Page Additional Styling

The following adaptations should be used to make the course overview page styled consistently and easier readable for students.

#### Section Dividers

To improve the visual flow in a course overview, you can add colored bars to further break up the content of a section.

![dividers](imgs/dividers.png)

**Section Dividers:** These can be used to sub-divide a section into **chapters** and give it a relevant chapter heading. Create a "Tag Resource" on the platform, and add the following HTML code in the HTML editor:

```html
<h5 class="section-divider">Relevant Chapter Heading</h5>
```

**Assignment Dividers:** To indicate to students that the following materials require their own input, we use differently-colored dividers for a section that consist of instructions for mini-projects, quizzes, etc. You can create such a divider also using the "Tag Resource" and entering the following HTML code in the HTML editor:

```html
<h5 class="section-assignment">Assignments</h5>
```

#### Module Tags

Module tags in the "Summary" of each section help students stay on track and visually bundle multiple sections logically together.

Switch off blue and yellow tags for better visual grouping.

Blue:

```html
<div class="d-flex flex-row-reverse">
  <span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary"> Module 1 </span>
</div>
```

Yellow:

```html
<div class="d-flex flex-row-reverse">
  <span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"> Module 2 </span>
</div>
```

### Page Resources Individual Styling

The following custom style elements should be considered when creating written documentation for your course content.

#### Headings

In the **visual editor**, use editor-provided headings levels:

- "Heading (large)" option creates `<h3>` element
- "Heading (medium)" option creates `<h4>` element
- "Heading (small)" option creates `<h5>` element

**Don't apply any editor styles to your headings.** We want to avoid individually bolded headings. Avoiding individual styles allows us to increase heading size, font-weight, etc. centrally through SCSS.

In **Markdown**, use the equivalent heading levels that the visual editor uses:

- Top-level heading: `###`
- Second-level heading: `####`
- Lowest-level heading: `#####`

#### Information And Alert Boxes

![Bootstrap alert box for information](imgs/alert-box-preview.png)

Add disclaimers as `alert alert-warning` boxes when a new concept is mentioned but not yet deeply explained. You want to avoid students feeling like this (student quote):

> you know, I think my main issue is if I get to a page, and the way it is written implies I should already understand it, but it is completely new and unfamiliar. It has me worrying that it is obvious and I am the only one just not getting it.

To avoid this frustration, use the Bootstrap alert box with a short note for criticial information and gotchas. E.g.:

> "Just read over this for now, we'll dig deeper into it in a later section."

```html
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Take care to avoid xyz.
</div>
```

Use `alert alert-info` to include additional information e.g. on external resources that can lead students further onwards. E.g.:

```html
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> The first bug was a real bug!
</div>
```

The Bootstrap alert boxes also help to visually break up a long piece of content by highlighting an important section.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3REbh9xr5lE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Note:** If you need to use **multiple lines** in your alert boxes, use `<br>` tags to create newlines (instead of using `<p>` tags). This results in nicer-looking alert boxes without additional spacing.

#### Code Blocks

Wrap code snippets into triple-backticks. This works both in Markdown as well as the visual editor:

    ```python
    print("your code here")
    ```

**Note:** Syntax highlighting can sometimes be broken. This might be annoying and we hope to find a fix that'll solve it site-wise.

#### In-line Code

**In Markdown**, simply wrap your in-line code into [**single backticks**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#code).

**In the visual editor**, there is no button for marking a section of text as inline code. Therefore, you will need to switch to the _HTML editor_ and wrap in-line code snippets into `<code>your_code()</code>` tags.

#### Embedded Resources

For external videos that are not hosted on our vimeo account and e.g. external code playgrounds, use [Bootstraps responsive embed class](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/embed/):

```html
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="your_embed_url" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

#### Resources

```html
<div class="jumbotron resources">
  <h1>Resources</h1>
</div>
```

Paste the above HTML snippet into the HTML editor of your resource. Next, switch back to the WYSIWYG editor view and copy-paste your resource links into the body of the jumbotron. Style them as a bullet point list. Result:

![resources](imgs/resources.png)

#### Quotes

To highlight a section of your documentation as a quote, please use the [Bootstrap-provided blockquote HTML](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/#blockquotes):

```html
<blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
  <p class="mb-0">
    [...] programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for
    machines to execute.
  </p>
  <footer class="blockquote-footer">
    Abelson & Sussman in
    <a
      href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-7.html#%_chap_Temp_4"
      ><cite title="Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"
        >Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</cite
      ></a
    >
  </footer>
</blockquote>
```

We are applying some custom CSS to it to make the quotes look like shown below:

![An adapted Bootstrap blockquote](imgs/blockquote.png)

#### LaTeX

If you use LaTeX for formulas, you'll have an easier time using the WYSIWYG editor. You can render block and inline LaTeX by following [moodle's LaTeX syntax](https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Using_TeX_Notation). Here's [how to switch your editor](02-markdown-course-creation.md#text-editor-choice).

If you want to use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) with the Marklar Markdown editor, keep in mind that it only supports LaTeX **blocks**:

```md
$$content$$
```

E.g. in order to display the following formula correctly rendered like so:

![rendered LaTeX formula](imgs/latex_rendered.png)

You can write the following in the Marklar editor:

```md
$$\text{EMA}_{t}=[V_t \times (\frac d {1+n})] + \text{EMA}_y \times [1 - \frac d {1+n}]$$
```

For more information, refer to [the LaTeX docs](https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/).

**Note:** If you need to use a couple of single-line LaTeX in a row, e.g. for explaining the contents of a formula in more detail, we suggest to use a [Bootstrap table](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/) for easier viewing, e.g.:

```html
<table class="table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1</th>
      <td>$$\text{EMA}_t=\text{EMA today}$$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">2</th>
      <td>$$p_t=\text{price today}$$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">3</th>
      <td>$$\text{EMA}_y=\text{EMA yesterday}$$</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

## [Video Slides](08-creating-videos.md#slides)

To keep a unified style across our different courses, use the [Slide Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15HOG5TyGKWfvP4ZcouKAb3CYhMWqdhLa75Np59jh7Iw/edit?usp=sharing) (or corresponding [Keynote Theme](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1m6jfPz803rZMDp1vLDKQz72nCLzek_UA)). More information in the dedicated [Video Slides](08-creating-videos.md#slides) section.

## Brand Colors

In case you need to highlight something, focus on using the following colors that reflect the colors in the CodingNomads logo:

- **primary:** sea blue

  - Hex value: `#0071BD`
  - RGB code: `rbg(0, 113, 189)`
  - HSV: `hsv(204.13, 100%, 74.12%)`

- **secondary:** sunset yellow (outermost)
  - Hex value: `#FBB03B`
  - RGB code: `rbg(251, 176, 59)`
  - HSV: `hsv(36.56, 76.49%, 98.43%)`

The general theme settings for our brand communication could reflect these two colors as **primary** (sea-blue) and **secondary** (sunset-yellow) brand colors.

## [Fonts](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AGnyJpEBqBqQyW_UJLY8cVWCWh1wCoQN)

When creating any content that includes fonts outside of our learning platform (e.g. Video Slides), stick to using the following fonts:

- `Barlow condensed` (titles)
- `Source Sans Pro` (text)
- `Roboto Mono` (code)

You can [download them all from here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AGnyJpEBqBqQyW_UJLY8cVWCWh1wCoQN).
