# Organization During Development
Explore whether it makes sense to use Trello boards on a per-course basis.

# General Course Settings
* set up auto-completion course-wide as follows:
    - _insert settings_

# Content
* stay DRM-free! We don't want to plagiarize.
    - Images: Only use images you made yourself or that are in the public domain. Creative Commons requires attribution, so post a link.
    - External Learning Resources: Link to great external resources you know of. Our main goal is for students to learn the topics. We want external resources to be clearly labeled and an _addition_ to our course content, not a replacement

# In-course quizzes
* quick and direct feedback - use "Adaptive Mode"
    - general quiz set-up guidelines
* sololearn style check-in quizzes

## Bootstrap Elements We Use
Avoid styling pages in the editor, it makes it individual and difficult to globally adapt and keep in sync.

Best way is to use Markdown with only little extra styling.

- headings (avoid bolding etc in editor)
- jumbotron resources
    * [Collapsible](https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=102) also cool for resources
    * create a PHP button to insert the HTML for such snippets?
- code blocks for different languages (plugins!)

# Thoughts
* “Workshop” resource for peer reviewed content

# Mobile
Mobile site available at https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn Tried it, works, and looks good! :)
