# CodingNomads Branding Resource

Central place to refer to for branding information.

To keep our message clear and easy to communicate, we want:

- **Unified Style:** Our visual offerings should look the same across all courses on the whole platform and additional web presence
- **Centralized Design:** We want to keep as much of the styling in one central style sheet
- **Adaptable Styling:** By centralizing the desing, it allows us to make style related updates that are reflected across all our offerings without having to e.g. dig into every course's code separately

## Colors

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">

<div>
    <p>My aim was to use the colors from our logo:</p>
    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/960981641689677824/ddu4i3as_400x400.jpg" width="250">
</div>

<div>

Specifically, I would suggest the two outer colors for primary branding:

<h4>sunset yellow (outermost)</h4>
<div style="display: flex">
    <div style="background-color: #FBB03B; width: 80px; height: 80px; color: white;">#FBB03B</div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML code:  #FBB03B</li>
            <li>RGB code:   R: 251 G: 176 B: 59</li>
            <li>HSV:    36.56° 76.49% 98.43%</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<h4>sea blue</h4>
<div style="display: flex">
    <div style="background-color: #0071BD; width: 80px; height: 80px; color: white;">#0071BD</div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML code:  #0071BD</li>
            <li>RGB code:   R: 0 G: 113 B: 189</li>
            <li>HSV:    204.13° 100% 74.12%</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

</div>

</div>

The general theme settings for our brand communication could reflect these two colors as **primary** (sea-blue) and **secondary** (sunset-yellow) brand colors.

## Fonts

What is the font that is currently used in the CodingNomads logo?

What is the font used in the beginning of video recordings? (I'd like to suggest course creators to use that same font if they make slides)
