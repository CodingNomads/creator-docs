# Course Completion

If you are using a copied starter course, these settings should already be selected correctly for you and you won't need to take further action.

Under `Edit / Course Completion / Default activity completion` you can check up on (and set) the following default completion for resources in your course:

- **Assignments**: Student must submit this activity to complete it
- **Feedback**: View as completed if the feedback is submitted
- **Journals, Pages, URLs, Video Time Instances**: Student must view this activity to complete it
- **Quizzes**: Student must receive a grade to complete this activity

Bulk editing for already existing resources can also be done in the same settings page under the `Bulk edit activity completion` tab.
