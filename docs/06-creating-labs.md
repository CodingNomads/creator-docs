# Lab Resources

_Under Construction_

**GitHub Hosted:** We host labs on GitHub, one folder per course. Our lab repos should look similar to [this course example](https://github.com/mikeckennedy/write-pythonic-code-demos) and link to signing up for the course in their README file.

Students download the `.zip` for the repo from GitHub at the beginning of their course. We want to encourage students to use version control and open-source right from the start.

Pro's and Con's for Downloading vs. Cloning:

- **Download:** No sync for updates we do
- **Clone:** requires some pre-existing Git knowledge


## Use Consistent Numbering

Double-digits for lab numbers (should we do triple?)

Here's a link to [a script that helps with renaming](https://github.com/CodingNomads/utils). It's likely that you'll need to rename, so feel free to use and customize as much as is helpful for you.
