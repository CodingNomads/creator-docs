# CodingNomads Forum

We want the forum to be an active place to share and discuss course content, coding challenges, tech news and tips, professional development, etc.

## Seed Posts (Getting Started)

Every Course should include an introduction to our forum. This introduction should include links to posts of general interest, that will help students getting started with our Learning Platform, and our Forum. Please encourage students to use the forum and include references to the following posts:

* [Offline Access To Course Materials](https://forum.codingnomads.co/t/offline-access-to-learning-materials/185)
* [Using The Mobile App](https://forum.codingnomads.co/t/using-the-mobile-app/186)

* [How To Format Your Code](https://forum.codingnomads.co/t/how-to-format-your-code/27)
