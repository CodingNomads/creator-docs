# Creating Quizzes

You can add a Quiz resource like any other resource in your course by clicking on `Add Resource` and selecting `Quiz`. Click on "Save and display" to create the Quiz.

**Note**: Creating a Quiz does not yet create any questions, this is a separate step that should be completed in the Question Bank.

## Use the Question Bank

Create and manage questions using the Moodle **Question Bank**.

### Create And Use Categories

These help to keep questions searchable and make it easier to add and edit questions related to a specific quiz.

## Question Behavior

We want students to receive immediate feedback if possible. Therefore, we encourage you to use **"Adaptive Mode"** (the default) for quiz questions. You can see other possible modes in Moodle's docs on [Question behaviour](https://docs.moodle.org/37/en/Question_behaviours).

**Note:** Please use other modes only if you have a good and justified reason to do so. Chat me up with those reasons before getting started.

## Feedback On Student Answers

Students should be able to "check" their answers to questions and receive feedback. For this, you will need to fill out the "Feedback" blocks when creating a question.
