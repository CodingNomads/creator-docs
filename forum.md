# CodingNomads Forum

We want the forum to be an active place to share and discuss code, professional development, etc.

## Seed Posts (Getting Started)

Every Course should include an introduction to our forum. This introduction should include links to posts of general interest, that will help students get started with the Learning Platform, and the Forum:
